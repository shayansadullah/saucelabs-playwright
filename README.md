What we are expecting:
• Using best practices write a Test framework that can test the above user journey
• Use Java or JavaScript with Cucumber/Gherkin and Selenium/WebDriverIO
• We don't expect every single aspect of the journey to be thoroughly tested, but
would expect to see scenario without glue code in such cases
